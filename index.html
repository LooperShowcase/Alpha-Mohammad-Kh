    The Parisians were founded in 1970, following the merger of Paris FC and
    Stade Saint-Germain. PSG won their first major honour, the French Cup, in
    1982 and their first Division 1 title in 1986. The 1990s was among the most
    successful periods in the club's history; they claimed a second league
    title, three French Cups, two French League Cups, two French Super Cups and
    the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1996. After suffering a decline in fortunes
    during the 2000s, the Red and Blues have enjoyed a revival since 2011 with
    increased financial backing, achieving unparalleled dominance in domestic
    competitions, winning multiple league titles and national cups. PSG have
    also become a regular feature in the UEFA Champions League, reaching their
    first final in 2020. PSG have the most consecutive seasons playing in
    France's top flight and are one of two French clubs to have won a major
    European title. They are the most popular football club in France and one of
    the most widely supported teams in the world. PSG's home kit colours are
    red, blue, and white, and their crest features the Eiffel Tower and a
    fleur-de-lis. Paris have a longstanding rivalry with Olympique de Marseille;
    the duo contest French football's most notorious match, Le Classique. Tamim
    bin Hamad Al Thani, the Emir of Qatar, owns Paris Saint-Germain through
    closed shareholders Qatar Sports Investments (QSI), which purchased the club
    in 2011. The takeover made PSG the richest club in France and one of the
    wealthiest in the world. Paris currently have the fifth-highest revenue in
    the footballing world with an annual revenue of â‚¬654m according to Deloitte,
    and are the world's seventh-most valuable football club, worth $3.2bn
    according to Forbes.
